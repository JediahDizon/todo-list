# Todo List
This utilizes React JS's potential to quickly create SPA with basic tasks such as this todo list application. This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Installation
- `npm install` Install the necessary node packages
- `npm start` Start the application and view it by going to `http://localhost:3000/`

## Features
Due to time constraints and the nature of a simple application, some features are ommitted

- ☑ Redux Store - Uses the `Action Creator`/`Action Types`/`Reducer` architecture to construct the global store
- ☑ Mock REST API - An added `delay` when performing asynchronous CRUD operations makes the mock REST api more believable
- ☑ Form Framework - Used to generate `forms` using [Ant Design's scalabale Form framework](https://ant.design/components/form/) which supports form validation
- ☑ Charts JS - Used to generate `graphs` using `React Chart JS 2` library to display statistical data
- ☐ WebPack - Used to minify the distribution payload
- ☐ Database - Used to persist saved todo items *(Omitted as per requirement)*
- ☐ Automated Testing - Test the components of the application
- ☐ ESLint - Used to check the programmer's code consistency to ESLint rules
